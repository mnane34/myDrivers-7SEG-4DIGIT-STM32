# Driver Development of 7-Segment 4-Digit Display on STM32 

# ‚ö° What is 7-Segment 4-Digit Display?

7-Segment 4-Digit Display is an electronic module composed of four seven-segment digits, each formed by LEDs arranged to display numbers 0‚Äì9 and some characters. It is commonly used in clocks, counters, and calculators for simple and clear numeric output. The digits are usually driven by multiplexing, which reduces power consumption while keeping the display readable.

# üî• How to Use an 7-Segment 4-Digit Display with Microcontrollers?

Using a 7-Segment 4-Digit Display, connect its segment and digit control pins to the microcontroller‚Äôs GPIOs. Use multiplexing to activate one digit at a time rapidly, creating the illusion that all digits are lit simultaneously. Finally, control the segments according to the number or character you want to display.

# üõ†Ô∏è Electrical Diagram

- **D1 (Digit 1 Control Pin)**<br>

Controls the first digit (leftmost). Setting HIGH or LOW (depending on common-anode/cathode) turns the digit ON or OFF.

- **D2 (Digit 2 Control Pin)**<br>

Controls the second digit. Used in multiplexing to select which digit is active.

- **D3 (Digit 3 Control Pin)**<br>

Controls the third digit. Activated during multiplexing to display its corresponding number.

- **D4 (Digit 4 Control Pin)**<br>

Controls the fourth digit. Only one digit is usually active at a time in multiplexing.

- **A (Segment A Pin)**<br>

Controls segment A of all digits, forming part of the displayed number.

- **B (Segment B Pin)**<br>

Controls segment B of all digits, forming part of the displayed number.

- **C (Segment C Pin)**<br>

Controls segment C of all digits, forming part of the displayed number.

- **D (Segment D Pin)**<br>

Controls segment D of all digits, forming part of the displayed number.

- **E (Segment E Pin)**<br>

Controls segment E of all digits, forming part of the displayed number.

- **F (Segment F Pin)**<br>

Controls segment F of all digits, forming part of the displayed number.

- **G (Segment G Pin)**<br>

Controls segment G of all digits, forming part of the displayed number.

- **DOT (Decimal Point Pin)**<br>

Controls the decimal point segment of all digits. Can be turned ON or OFF independently.
